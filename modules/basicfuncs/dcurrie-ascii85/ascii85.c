// From Wikipedia re: Ascii85 length...
// Adobe adopted the basic btoa encoding, but with slight changes, and gave it the name Ascii85.
// The characters used are the ASCII characters 33 (!) through 117 (u) inclusive (to represent
// the base-85 digits 0 through 84), together with the letter z (as a special case to represent
// a 32-bit 0 value), and white space is ignored. Adobe uses the delimiter "~>" to mark the end
// of an Ascii85-encoded string, and represents the length by truncating the final group: If the
// last block of source bytes contains fewer than 4 bytes, the block is padded with up to three
// null bytes before encoding. After encoding, as many bytes as were added as padding are
// removed from the end of the output.
// The reverse is applied when decoding: The last block is padded to 5 bytes with the Ascii85
// character "u", and as many bytes as were added as padding are omitted from the end of the
// output (see example).
// NOTE: The padding is not arbitrary. Converting from binary to base 64 only regroups bits and
// does not change them or their order (a high bit in binary does not affect the low bits in the
// base64 representation). In converting a binary number to base85 (85 is not a power of two)
// high bits do affect the low order base85 digits and conversely. Padding the binary low (with
// zero bits) while encoding and padding the base85 value high (with 'u's) in decoding assures
// that the high order bits are preserved (the zero padding in the binary gives enough room so
// that a small addition is trapped and there is no "carry" to the high bits).

// NOTE: ths implementation does not ignore white space!
//
// The motivation for this implementation is as a binary message wrapper for serial
// communication; in that application, white space is used for message framing.
